# Other cool tools

We have designed other plugins for CODAP that you might enjoy.
These have their own online booklets
in the same style as this book.

## Simmer

`Simmer` was originally designed as a probability simulation
tool where you program it using 
a block-programming interface (Ã  la *Scratch*, 
in fact based on the *Blockly* library from Google).

So, for example, if you wanted to simulate rolling
two dice and adding, you might write this program:

![](art/two-dice-program.png){width="70%" fig-align="center"}

This will result in a CODAP table with 36 cases with 
suitable random values in the `die1` and `die2` columns.

## Arbor

`Arbor` lets you construct and analyze classification trees. 
These are very interesting alternatives to traditional graphs
that work well whenever you're trying to sort cases
into two groups. 

One good context is *medical*: 
you're trying to diagnose patients as sick or well.
But there are other great contexts such as spam detection, as in,
based on the subject line of an email, can you tell if it's 
spam or not?

Here's another: what characteristics of *Titanic* passengers
are associated with survival?
Here is an `arbor` tree made with that data:

![](art/titanic-3-leaves.png){width="70%" fig-align="center"}

The tool will also let you make a confusion matrix
(the familiar 2x2 table) of your diagnoses
and see a mosaic plot of that information.

For a *lot* more about trees, 
[click this link for the `arbor` guide](https://codap.xyz/guides/before-the-CART).

As you will see, that guide is also an online resource
for a 2023 paper from *Teaching Statistics*.
