    "text": "3 Lessons Overview\nThe first “Part” of this book—the next few chapters—contains lessons and assignments for a quick introduction to data science. I created these lessons for students in a high school, as part of a class called “Applied Mathematics,” which includes a number of topics including consumer-ish math. This introduction occupied a couple of weeks of class time, roughly four seventy-five minute blocks. Although the students varied widely in their level of preparation, they were generally polite, attentive, and well-intentioned.\nWe ran this most recently in the Spring of 2020, under quarantine, when the class was “virtual,” run over Zoom. The lessons here roughly parallel what we did in class that time, when students were isolated in their homes and groupwork was possible, but harder than “before.” The discussion suggestions in the lessons work fine, but not as well as in an in-person classroom. Therefore I think these lessons might also work, with sensible modifications, for self-study. For example, you will not be turning in your projects—unless you want to send them to me; I’d love to see them!\nLikewise, if you are a teacher with a class of your own, of course you should modify what you see here so that it makes sense for your students and your situation. For example, our school uses Google apps extensively, so students all know about setting permissions and submitting links to Google docs via email. In previous years, I had insisted that students make pdfs and email those in. What works for you depends on your situation.\nYou may want to modify assignments, add new ones, skip others. Go for it. I will try to describe, here and in the commentary that accompanies each element in this Part, my rationale for the order and content I chose.\nClass preparation: We (the teacher-of-record and I) set up a Google doc as a “landing page” for the class. It had material that students would need: links to class-specific instructions, links to the CODAP software and to this book, as well as links to various data sets. Before each class, we edited the doc so that today’s most important links were at the top, with an agenda of what we would do. That way, all past links and agendas were still in the document, at the bottom, in reverse chronological order.\nFor the first lesson, for example, we had a link to this book and to a blank CODAP document, with advice to bookmark the page. We also had a link to an “800 children and teens” document, which we easily got to in the first session.\nThose data links are also embedded in this book, so if your students use this book (for ours, this was just a resource), or you are doing self-study, there’s no need to make an extra set of links."

The attributes (a.k.a. variables) include age, gender, height, weight, armspan, upper arm length, and pulse. We will eventually focus on age, gender, and height—but we don’t tell students that at first.\nEventually, we focus on how height changes with age—and how it also depends on gender. That presents a problem that often makes students feel “awash”: they have three attributes but only two axes on a graph. The obvious solutions—multiple graphs, color the points—don’t work out very well.\n\nFiltering. We show students a different approach, using a data move: filtering. We look at only a small part of the data, just the 10-year-olds (where the girls are taller!). Then it’s easy to compare the boys and the girls in a graph, now that age is not a factor.\nGetting to the filtering is the critical part of the lesson, and sets up the groupwork described in that chapter: each group does this filtering move for different ages, pooling the class data so students can enter and plot the mean ages for each gender at each age. For logistics, we created a shared Google sheet where students entered the means."

This should be simple—simple enough that they could conceivably do the data analysis using the live illustration embedded in the assignment.\nThis assignment is written so it’s entirely done in CODAP (no Google doc at this point), so it can be done and turned in in class (although some students might not finish). It could even be done orally, though we did it as an assignment to turn in.\nMany students will use this dataset to compare incomes, and that will often lead into social justice issues. We love that kind of topic, and students are often intrigued and motivated that they are exploring it with real data about real people."

This chapter introduces grouping cases in the dataset by reorganizing the table and summarizing those groups by calculating summary (or aggregate) values, in this case, mean heights. These are our second and third core data moves. Conceptually, it’s the most subtle—and powerful—part of this intro to data science. Your goal, as a teacher, is to get as many students as possible to understand this.\n\nThe session may begin with the students entering the mean heights by gender and age that they worked on in groups. They can then make the summary graph. If they made this graph already (e.g., in the previous session), remind them of it.\n\nRemind students that that process used the filtering data move.\n\nNow students will learn how to have the computer do all that. This is perfect for a demo. Get their close attention and go through it slowly, sometimes backing up as students have questions. There are two main parts: making the groups; and then making the aggregate calculation. The text in the chapter has all sorts of questions embedded in it; use them to guide how you show students this technique.\nYou will probably end the session debriefing the first assignment (with the Census data) and previewing the second one."

    "text": "A Second Assignment\nHere is a link to the assignment\nThis is a more complex version of that first assignment. Notice these differences:\n\nLogistical issues:\n\nIt’s supposed to be a Google doc, not just a CODAP doc. (If you want a different format, go ahead!)\nStudents put a link to their CODAP doc in the Google doc.\nThey need to learn how to get a graph into the Google doc.\nIf possible, they should use that grouping move they just saw, and, in addition, calculate summary values for the groups.\n\nThey need to enhance their investigation and give it more nuance. We refer to this in the text as “dig deeper.”\nThey need to pay more attention to communication, for example in the size and choice of their graphics and the coherence of their narrative.\n\n\nStudents may be perplexed about what we mean by “dig deeper.” An early section in the chapter contains an example of the kind of thing they could do—exploring the obvious issue of income disparity between males and females—and then shows what “digging deeper” might look like.\n\nThe other difference is that we restrict the topic: We give them just two claims to choose from. Most students become invested in the Census data. It’s engaging, and quickly brings social issues into math class. But they need an alternative; ours is data from BART, the Bay Area Rapid Transit. There are links in the assignment to orient you and those students to the data.\n\nThe next class session\nIn our most recent class, some students “got” this assignment and were done in a flash. For others, the whole grouping-and-aggregation thing was alien and complex. That’s not surprising: it is conceptually the hardest part of this unit.\nSo you cannot expect students to have completed even this simple task by the beginning of the next session. We devoted pretty much the whole session to working on this task, giving students help individually and in small groups, and getting them to help each other.\nFor students who were moving faster, we presented the “small project” task (below) and let them get started. It might be better, however, to give them other useful things to do. In an in-person class, these students could be resources for their peers, or we could have given them other enriching problems to solve. There are some in this book (xxx) that were not available at that time."

As an example of this last possibility, some students, independently, wanted to connect the Census data to data that wasn’t in the data set, that is, to link our data to external data. That’s another data move we call joining, so we’ve added a chapter about it even though it’s not really part of a simple introduction to data science.\nHere is a link to that chapter"

    "text": "2.1 Commentary (a.k.a TL;DR)^[Teachers and other oldsters,\njust in case this is new: TL;DR means “Too Long; Didn’t Read.”]\nWe will include sections like this from time to time. Here is some meta-commentary, that is, commentary about this commentary:\n\nYou can learn a lot in this book even if you skip these sections. But doing things—actually interacting with the data—is more important than reading.\nTeachers: we will have suggestions for how to present this material and why we think it’s important.\nStudents: this may tell you what the teacher cares about in case you want to focus on something.\n\nEnough meta. Onward!\n\nOverview\nThe file has data about things like LifeSpan, Speed, and Diet for 27 species of mammal. Doing the activity, you make graphs of these attributes. This dataset is problematic in a number of ways, and does not smell like data science. Nevertheless, it’s a good place to start.\n\nWhat we’re calling attributes you could just as well call variables or even column headings. Sometimes I will use variable when my audience is likely to understand what I mean, and when attribute might make them pause longer than I want. Why “attributes?” See this section from a chapter in the distant future.\n\nWhen you first make a graph, the points appear randomly (but they still represent the data; try clicking on one and see what happens in the table). To organize the points, that is, to make a meaningful graph, do what we always tell students to do when making graphs by hand: label your axis, that is, drag a label—the name of an attribute—from the column heading to an axis of the graph.\n\n\nThe “Starting CODAP” Lesson\nYou could conceivably assign this for homework so that students “hit the ground running.” But it also works well simply to give them the link in class and let them do the task together.\n\nEncourage talking to others.\nWalk around and make sure everybody is eventually making graphs; at the end everyone should have bivariate graphs—different attributes on the two axes. These could be scatter plots or parallel dot plots.\nIf students are having trouble, have other students help them before you do.\n\nThe underlying point is that students do not need you to explain things. They can figure out a lot by themselves, and in collaboration with other students.\nThey should be secure in making graphs in just a few minutes. Stop them from spending too much time with this data set, and maybe lead the class in a discussion. Some possible issues:\n\nDid anybody get lots of colored points in your graph? How did you do that? (“Plop” an attribute into the middle of a graph)\nThe graph of Speed and the graph of Diet are qualitatively different. How? Why?\nWhat happens when you click on a point in a graph? (The same case gets selected in the table—and in any other graphs)\nWhat happens when you hover over a point in a graph?\nWhat does one row of the table represent? (Importantly: a species, not the common response, an animal.)\nHow do you change the size of the points in a graph? (It’s in the “paintbrush” palette. But maybe don’t tell them; Let somebody discover it and tell the class.)\nWhy are there no birds in this dataset?\n\n\nThese discussions have multiple purposes. They help students listen to each other and feel part of a community. And they also let you highlight software features that students will need to know about. Ideally, students highlight these features to each other, so it’s not always your voice.\n\n\nThis is important because students will go in different directions. If we wrote instructions for everything students might need, we would forever be teaching features and never get to exploring; furthermore, many students would be bored. So we delay learning about some features until students need them or discover them by accident. The best transmission is often viral: Zak sees that Annabelle has a graph with colored points, so he asks her how she got them. Then, in the discussion, she gets to tell the class and we can step in with the cool enhancement: here, in the paintbrush palette, is where you can change the colors. Everybody will remember."

The whole long tail of short people—for both males and females–is made up of little kids. If you’re not convinced, drop Age into the middle of the graph.\nGo ahead, we’ll wait.\n\nIn general (the graph says), the short people are younger. Make sure you can explain how the graph shows that. What is it about the colors that says short people are younger?\n\nStill, it’s a confusing graph. Let’s make it simpler.\nInstead of looking at everybody we have, ages 5–19, let’s just look at one age: 10-year-olds. First we’ll filter the graph so it shows only 10-year-olds. Then we’ll compare the heights of those boys and those girls.\nYou get a fresh, live document below. Follow these steps for the filtering:\n\nDrag Age to the horizontal axis so you have a graph of Height against Age.\nTake a moment to discuss (or reflect) on whether that graph makes sense.

Drop the attribute there instead of on the axis; it will add the data to the plot instead of replacing it."

    "section": "3.5 Commentary",
    "text": "3.5 Commentary\nThere are three main phases to this lesson.\n\nFirst, students mess around with the data, making graphs using any attributes they like, looking for relationships. Ideally, a few of them get to show and explain their graphs, and you run a discussion as decscribed in the commentary.\nIn the second phase, we focus on a specific issue: who is taller, females or males? We learn to show means on the graph. When the obvious analysis doesn’t work well, and we are still awash in data, we get even more specific and focus on 10-year-olds. We use a data move, filtering, to do this. Very important.\nIf possible, there’s a third phase where students—probably in groups— find the mean heights for boys and girls at each age, then plot those results.\n\nThe final graph tells a clear story about height and gender and age.\n\nWho is taller? More detail…\nIn the first, exploratory phase, somebody probably made a graph with height and age or height and gender. Explain that we will now focus on this issue.\nIn a class—even online—rather than having students read the instructions and do this alone or in pairs, I do this next part as a demo, and go through the process outlined in the text. I focus on height versus gender, with questions along the way (e.g., Why is height on the vertical axis? Because it’s the response? Right. But also, because height is vertical.)\nI make the graph and show how to put the means on the graph using the ruler palette. We see, by hovering, the different values. We ask, “Are we done? Males are taller than females?”\nAnd if no one says so, we tell them that actually, there is something deeply bogus (or hinky or whatever the current term is) about our graph. It’s a fine graph, but it’s unfair. Why? What’s missing?\nWait time. Wait time.\nSomeone will say “age.” Probe for what they mean. Plop Age onto the graph to see the color gradient. Yeah, the tails are all little kids.\nEarlier someone might have made the graph of Height against Age. You can refer back to it, and make that graph for the class. If they haven’t, you can do it, plopping Gender into the middle.\nWhat do you think about this graph? Is it clear what’s going on? Partly, but it’s hard work to read this graph. It’s still confusing. Let’s find a way to have this make more sense.\nSo we do the filtering move: we select the 10-year-olds and hide the rest, then put Gender on the axis and show the mean heights of each group, reflecting on the realization that, although in general the males are taller, the story is different for particular ages.\nThat’s about as much lecture/demo as we can tolerate, so we switch to a different mode.\n\n\nGroupwork! Getting the means in more detail…\nWhat if we did that procedure—looking at only the ten-year-olds, and recording the mean heights of the males and females— but for every age?\nIt would be really cool. So we do exactly that. Every group gets an age or two to be in charge of. Their task is to find the mean heights of males and females at those ages. Groups post the means in a table on the class whiteboard or in a Google Sheet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroups post mean heights in a Google Sheet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValues from the sheet, plotted in CODAP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fact that it was groups gave students a welcome break, a chance to talk, and also reinforced that key skill of filtering. When we were in quarantine, we did this in randomized Zoom breakouts. We had pre-assigned the ages to group numbers.\n\n\nIn addition, this part of the activity gave students practice with computing means; introduced how to enter your own data into CODAP; and most importantly showed them where you can go with this.\n\nI think it’s important that the filtering and typing will be slow and a little laborious, for two reasons: first, of course, when you show them how the computer can do it in the next lesson, they will see how cool and time-saving it is. Second, slowing down highlights this idea of turning the means into values in a table that you can graph. It gives it time to sink in.\n\n\nThe key moment: filtering\n\nFiltering is our first data move. When we display all the data, the Heightvs.Age graph does make sense, and it tells a story, but it’s complicated. Looking at it, we’re pretty “awash in data.”\n\nFor example, we were trying to compare heights across genders, right? But the height-age graph doesn’t have gender (left-hand illustration). What if we drop Gender onto the middle of the graph? You’ll get something like the right-hand illustration (and you should do it yourself).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeight by age, no gender.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSame, with Gender. This is confusing. We’re awash.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can kind of see that males are taller, at least older males are taller, but it’s not really clear because so many of the points are stacked on top of each other. You can’t tell whether purples are hiding under oranges or what.\nBut when we filter, and look at only the 10-year-olds, everything is clearer. Looking at that graph, we are no longer “awash.” It’s all manageable.\n\n\n\n\n\nHeights of ten-year-olds, split by gender (again).\n\n\n\nThe dots are not hiding each other any more.\nThere are fewer dots altogether.\nIt’s a normal kind of graph, a kind we might be more used to reading.\n\nOr, more deeply, this graph reduces the dimensionality of the problem. Before the filtering, we really needed to show three attributes at once: Height, Age, and Gender. But our graph has only two dimensions.\nBy focusing only on the 10-year-olds, we eliminate the Age attribute: it’s now irrelevant because everybody we’re looking at is 10 years old. That means we can use that horizontal, Age axis for Gender instead.\nWe’re still interested in age—after all, it has a big influence on height— but we have decided to ignore it, temporarily, strategically. We used the filtering data move to help us be less awash, to help us see something familiar.\nThat familiarity can also be an inspiration for what to do next, for how to “dig deeper” into the data."

    "section": "Overview",
    "text": "Overview\nThe first “Part” of this book—the next few chapters—contains lessons and assignments for a quick introduction to data science. I created these lessons for students in a high school, as part of a class called “Applied Mathematics,” which includes a number of topics including consumer-ish math. This introduction occupied a couple of weeks of class time, roughly four seventy-five minute blocks. Although the students varied widely in their level of preparation, they were generally polite, attentive, and well-intentioned.\nWe ran this most recently in the Spring of 2020, under quarantine, when the class was “virtual,” run over Zoom. The lessons here roughly parallel what we did in class that time, when students were isolated in their homes and groupwork was possible, but harder than “before.” The discussion suggestions in the lessons work fine, but not as well as in an in-person classroom. Therefore I think these lessons might also work, with sensible modifications, for self-study. For example, you will not be turning in your projects—unless you want to send them to me; I’d love to see them!\nLikewise, if you are a teacher with a class of your own, of course you should modify what you see here so that it makes sense for your students and your situation. For example, our school uses Google apps extensively, so students all know about setting permissions and submitting links to Google docs via email. In previous years, I had insisted that students make pdfs and email those in. What works for you depends on your situation.\nYou may want to modify assignments, add new ones, skip others. Go for it. I will try to describe, here and in the commentary that accompanies each element in this Part, my rationale for the order and content I chose.\nClass preparation: We (the teacher-of-record and I) set up a Google doc as a “landing page” for the class. It had material that students would need: links to class-specific instructions, links to the CODAP software and to this book, as well as links to various data sets. Before each class, we edited the doc so that today’s most important links were at the top, with an agenda of what we would do. That way, all past links and agendas were still in the document, at the bottom, in reverse chronological order.\nFor the first lesson, for example, we had a link to this book and to a blank CODAP document, with advice to bookmark the page. We also had a link to an “800 children and teens” document, which we easily got to in the first session.\nThose data links are also embedded in this book, so if your students use this book (for ours, this was just a resource), or you are doing self-study, there’s no need to make an extra set of links."

For logistics, we created a shared Google sheet where students entered the means."

    "text": "2.1 Commentary (a.k.a TL;DR)1\nWe will include sections like this from time to time. Here is some meta-commentary, that is, commentary about this commentary:\n\nYou can learn a lot in this book even if you skip these sections. But doing things—actually interacting with the data—is more important than reading.\nTeachers: we will have suggestions for how to present this material and why we think it’s important.\nStudents: this may tell you what the teacher cares about in case you want to focus on something.\n\nEnough meta. Onward!\n\nOverview\nThe file has data about things like LifeSpan, Speed, and Diet for 27 species of mammal. Doing the activity, you make graphs of these attributes. This dataset is problematic in a number of ways, and does not smell like data science. Nevertheless, it’s a good place to start.\n\nWhat we’re calling attributes you could just as well call variables or even column headings. Sometimes I will use variable when my audience is likely to understand what I mean, and when attribute might make them pause longer than I want. Why “attributes?” See this section from a chapter in the distant future.\n\nWhen you first make a graph, the points appear randomly (but they still represent the data; try clicking on one and see what happens in the table). To organize the points, that is, to make a meaningful graph, do what we always tell students to do when making graphs by hand: label your axis, that is, drag a label—the name of an attribute—from the column heading to an axis of the graph.\n\n\nThe “Starting CODAP” Lesson\nYou could conceivably assign this for homework so that students “hit the ground running.” But it also works well simply to give them the link in class and let them do the task together.\n\nEncourage talking to others.\nWalk around and make sure everybody is eventually making graphs; at the end everyone should have bivariate graphs—different attributes on the two axes. These could be scatter plots or parallel dot plots.\nIf students are having trouble, have other students help them before you do.\n\nThe underlying point is that students do not need you to explain things. They can figure out a lot by themselves, and in collaboration with other students.\nThey should be secure in making graphs in just a few minutes. Stop them from spending too much time with this data set, and maybe lead the class in a discussion. Some possible issues:\n\nDid anybody get lots of colored points in your graph? How did you do that? (“Plop” an attribute into the middle of a graph)\nThe graph of Speed and the graph of Diet are qualitatively different. How? Why?\nWhat happens when you click on a point in a graph? (The same case gets selected in the table—and in any other graphs)\nWhat happens when you hover over a point in a graph?\nWhat does one row of the table represent? (Importantly: a species, not the common response, an animal.)\nHow do you change the size of the points in a graph? (It’s in the “paintbrush” palette. But maybe don’t tell them; Let somebody discover it and tell the class.)\nWhy are there no birds in this dataset?\n\n\nThese discussions have multiple purposes. They help students listen to each other and feel part of a community. And they also let you highlight software features that students will need to know about. Ideally, students highlight these features to each other, so it’s not always your voice.\n\n\nThis is important because students will go in different directions. If we wrote instructions for everything students might need, we would forever be teaching features and never get to exploring; furthermore, many students would be bored. So we delay learning about some features until students need them or discover them by accident. The best transmission is often viral: Zak sees that Annabelle has a graph with colored points, so he asks her how she got them. Then, in the discussion, she gets to tell the class and we can step in with the cool enhancement: here, in the paintbrush palette, is where you can change the colors. Everybody will remember."

It might be a median, or a sum, or just the count (a.k.a. frequency) of the cases in the group. It could even be a percentage, like the percentage of people in the group who have a BMI under 30.\n\nCODAP has a number of functions that serve as summaries.

So do it!\n\nMake a new graph; put Age on the horizontal axis and MeanHeight on the vertical.\n\nYou will see the pattern you might expect: people get taller as they age, up to a point.1\nWe still don’t see the gender differences. Here’s what you do. Watch what happens carefully and make sure you understand it.\n\nDrag Gender left in the table and drop it next to Age.\n\nEach item in the left table splits into males and females. So where there were the 15 ages before, now there are 30 age-gender combinations. Also, the right-hand table is now divided into 30 groups, one for each age-gender combination. The MeanHeight column now automatically shows the mean height for the cases in that group.\n\n\n\nA plot of mean height against age.

    "text": "5.4 Commentary\nThis is the conceptual heart of this unit.\nGrouping and summarizing are at the center af a huge amount of data analysis. The process is surprsingly deep, too: a group of programmers made this capability in CODAP, and even they didn’t realize how important, how useful it turned out to be. We guarantee you that no student, no matter how brilliant, will fully understand the consequences of that drag-left-in-the-table gesture. One miracle is the way that, when you dragged Gender left to join Age, those two attributes combined to define 30 groups instead of 152, and the formula column adjusted so that it consistently calculated mean height for every group.\nAt the same time, it’s only sorting the data into groups and taking the mean. It is not rocket science. It’s not even AP Statistics. I think there are really two reasons this is hard.\nOne is that there’s so much data, we need the computer to help. That means instructing it—by dragging left3— as to what, precisely, we want it to do. That involves computational thinking, having a sense of what kinds of things the computer can do, and the kinds of instructions that work.\nBut the other reason it’s hard is more insidious: you have to want to group by age and gender, and then take the mean of each group.\nSo, how to teach it? As with the first part of our height investigation, I did much of this lesson as a demo, with students following along. I went slowly, asking and answering questions, going back and repeating sections as students got their screens to show what they saw on mine. You can let students know that if they forget any of it when they’re doing future work, they can find a step-by-step description in this book. The next assignment will give them a chance to practice these skills.\nAs a teacher, you will need to be patient but persistent as students gradually come to understand how this works. You can get additional help and perspective in the “data move” chapters on Grouping and Summarizing.\nAs to developing an intuition about what to group by and why, and how to summarize, my conjecture is that by seeing it a few times, many students will start to get it, even without being able to articulate what’s going on. I also believe, though, that we teachers can gently point out and name the data moves we are making, and remark on their consequences. (“And look! By grouping and summarizing, we now have only 30 points instead of 800. What do you think? Is this graph easier to understand?”)\nWith that prodding, we nudge them towards metacognition.\n\nSummarizing loses information\nDo not think for a moment, however, that summarizing is a panacea. It’s a tool, and we must recognize its limitations and weaknesses. Sure, we went from 800 points down to 30. What happened to those 770 missing points?\nThe sweep of the means in our graph is lovely, and elegantly shows the overall pattern of growth of girls and boys, but it ignores the individuals. It ignores variability.\nTherefore, even if there is no time for a whole lesson on this topic, be sure to ring that chime from time to time. Ask, does this graph mean that every seven-year-old is this height? Or show a graph of only sixteen-year-olds. Notice that some girls are taller than a lot of the boys, and that some boys are really short. Invite students to speculate how they could draw a graph that showed the overall story and, at the same time, showed the variability.\nThat is, rescue students from the tyranny of the center. As a society we are often held in thrall. We hear that median home prices in Westview are higher than in Dust Gulch, so we assume that evey home is Dust Gulch is a shack and every one in Westview a mansion. We read that test scores (which are always mean test scores) are higher in Blue Sky Unified, so we assume that our children will get a good education only if we move there."

    "text": "4.4 Commentary\nData science demands communication. We create graphs and other visualizations in order to get our ideas across. They often illustrate a narrative, a story about the data and about our investigation, written out as text.\nStudents (and teachers) may not be used to writing in a mathy class. Furthermore, the style of writing will be different than what they’re used to in, say, English or History. It’s technical writing, explaining procedures and reasoning. Still, the objective is the same: to communicate clearly.\n\nMini-projects\nAnother challenge is that this kind of assignment is a balancing act: it’s a mini-project, less straightforward than a set of problems to solve. But it’s not a big project; we want students to do it reasonably quickly, and not get weighted down with deadlines, drafts, and expectations. That’s one reason why it’s limited to one text box.\nWhen students are not used to this kind of assignment, the first few are often terrible. That’s OK. They (and you, the teacher) haven’t figured out what you’re looking for. (Though that’s why we had that section, “how do you know when you’re done?”) The work will improve with practice, but only if students do at least three of these. Whence, short.\nThis initial assignment is, as advertised, designed partly to get students through the mechanics: negotiating sharing in CODAP and turning things in by emailing a URL. It’s also conceptually simple, perhaps confusingly simple, in order to make it possible to focus on those mechanics.\n\n\nDo an example?\nTo that end, as a teacher, you could demonstrate this assignment in front of the class. Here are two ideas for graphs to start with:\n\nIncome by Gender\nAge by marital status\n\nPick one, show how to make the graph and rescale it, and brainstorm with the class what you could say in two or three sentences.\nFor example:\nI claim that people who have never been married are generally younger than married people. This makes sense because once you’re married, you can never go back to being never-married. As you can see in the graph, the mean age for never-married people is in fact lower. There is still overlap, however: some unmarried people are pretty old, like, over 40.1\nHaving given an example, you could then tell students to do something like that, only different.\nBe sure to include how to share a CODAP doc.\n\n\nRescaling and Reordering\nMany students will probably do something with income. The problem is that income is highly skewed, and that means that space in the graph is scrunched down at the low end. If you put box plots or other measures on the data and compare males and females, they will not look as different as they might.\nSo to communicate a difference you want to highlight, you might rescale the axes even if it means losing some of the high-income outliers. (This gives you a chance to talk about whether that’s a good idea and how to cope with it.)\n\n\n\nGender by income\n\n\n\n\n\nSame thing, scaled\n\n\nIn any case, to rescale axes in CODAP, grab the numbers on an axis near one end and drag. In the illustration, we grabbed the top axis up at about $350,000 and dragged to the right.\nYou can do the same thing with a categorical axis, but there, dragging re-orders categories.\n\n\nDebriefing\nAfter you look over the assignments, you will want to discuss them with the class. Of course you can use this time to praise innovation and tenacity, and to point out where the work needs improvement. Here are some additional suggestions:\n\nHave some students present their work, especially if it investigated unusual attributes or used interesting new CODAP techniques.\nPoint out areas no students might have explored. For example, our two ideas above are both numerical attributes grouped according to a categorical one. What about two categoricals—what would that look like? (For example, gender and marital status.)\nPoint out CODAP features that need revealing such as rescaling axes or (xxx) fusing dots into bars.\nCompare putting one attribute on each axis as opposed to putting one on an axis and the other “plopped” into the middle as a legend. Actually put someone’s graph up, and then make another graph done the other way.\nAsk about the data in general, e.g., ask about what the income distribution looks like, and what that means in context (there are very few people making a lot of money, and a lot making not much; this is also a great time to discuss or review why median is a good alternative to mean for this data)."

Here are two alternatives:\n\nClick the camera palette in the graph and…\n\nchoose Export Image (you can also Open in Draw Tool).\nchoose Local File and pick where you want to save the file.\nafter saving the file, import it (it’s in .png format) or do a copy/paste into your Doc.\n\nUse a screen-capture utility to get an image of your graph, and then paste it into your doc.\n\nPro tip: Be conscious of space. Noobs often just paste huge graphs into their documents and leave them that way. After pasting, shrink the graph so that it’s a reasonable size. What’s reasonable? When you print it out, it should still be easy to read any text. For a typical CODAP graph, that’s no bigger than about 1/6 of a page. If you know how to wrap text around a graphic, sometimes that can look very professional."

    "text": "6.2 Example: Gender and Income\nHere’s an example of the kind of thing we have in mind:\nSuppose we were interested in gender and income. The simple approach is to (duh) plot gender and income. The graph alone looks vaguely like the men get more, but if you put the median on the graph, and rescale it, it’s really obvious:\n\n\n\nTotalIncome split by Gender, with lines showing median income for each group.\n\n\nThis is what we probably expect: men earn more than women. If we look at median values, men earn $17,000, versus $9,200 for the women. But does that tell the whole story? How could we dig deeper? (…as required in the assignment)\nWe might ask:\n\nIs it possible that the incomes really are equal, but we’re looking at it wrong?\nCan we be more nuanced? For example, is there some other factor that affects income?\n\nLooking at the graph, see the large number of people who seem to earn zero—or close to it? That spike at zero is taller for women. Maybe that’s because more women work in the home, and are not paid.\nSo maybe the incomes for people with jobs are equal between men and women, but because more women do not get paid, their median income is lower overall. This reasoning is an example of exploring whether we’re looking at it wrong, and that there is another factor—employment—that affects income. That is, it’s not just gender.\nTo test this idea, let’s just look at people with jobs. It turns out that we can get data for an attribute (a column) called EmplStatus for “employment status.”\n\nThat means you could filter to focus your investigation on people with jobs. That way, you can explore whether men with jobs generally earn more than women with jobs.\n\nTry that in the live illustration below. The “employment status” attribute is at the far right of the table.\n\n\n\nYou should find that the men still earn more. If you hide everyone but those that are “Civilian employed,” the men earn $45,000 to the women’s $30,000. So the fact that more women do unpaid work does not completely explain the difference in income.\nNotice that this will only work if you have downloaded EmplStatus data. If you get partway through your investigation and realize that you wish you had downloaded something else, or something more, you can’t add additional columns to the cases you already have. But remember: starting over is free. Just go back and get fresh data with the attributes you want."

Then you would make a new column (maybe called medInc) in which you would calculate the median income for each gender.\nLook back at the section where we made groups by age if you don’t remember how.\nThen think about how you can use grouping to help with your “dig deeper” work.\n\nWhen you drag Gender to the axis of a graph, CODAP helps you do a grouping data move. Then, when you put the median on the graph, that’s summarizing. For this assignment, though, we want you to make those moves explicitly—grouping by dragging left, summarizing in a new column with a formula— because (a) it’s good practice and (b) it’s more flexible."

It’s like fleshing out a sketch and making it more detailed.\nBut it’s also about being skeptical. When you make an initial, obvious graph, and draw some conclusion or make some claim, a skeptic steps back and wonders whether that’s really correct. Is there some other explanation for what you are seeing?\nYou can think of this as a “yes, but” attitude. It’s also the role of a “devil’s advocate”—someone whose job is to tear down an argument. If the devil’s advocate succeeds, that’s good, because without that skepticism, the conclusion would have been wrong. And if the devil’s advocate fails, that’s good too, because by passing that test, the original conclusion is stronger.\nSkepticism is not always confrontational, however. You can also think of it as a “yes, and” attitude: the claim may be right as far as it goes, but there may be other important considerations.\nIn the case of gender and height, we saw that, indeed, males were generally taller than females, but only after about age 13."

    "text": "6.5 Commentary\nYour job as a student is to try really hard to understand the bit about dragging left to make groups, and making new columns with calculations. If you’re feeling challenged enough already, pick the claim about education and income.\nHere’s some advice for how to explore and get comfortable:\n\nMake a graph, any graph. Try different groupings: drag one attribute left, and see what happens. Then drag the first one back and then try a different one.\nTry making a group (like for education) and adding an additional attribute (like gender) to the left. See what groups exist now.\nSelect groups on the left by clicking in that row. See what gets selected in the graph.\nWhen you make a column and give it a formula, try different formulas and see what happens.\nRemember that the name of your “formula” column is just a name. It’s not the formula. So if the column is named MeanIncome and the formula is median(income) you will get the median. (You should change the name!)\nChange what’s on the graph. Make more graphs! Try graphs with a calculated attribute on an axis.\n\nOh and:\n\nTry dragging TotalIncome to the left and see why that’s a terrible idea.\n\nIf you just mess around for a while like that, you will probably see something that addresses your claim. You may even have created something that will be perfect for your “dig deeper” section.\nTwo last key pieces of advice:\n\nWhen you make a grouping or summarizing move, stop for a moment and be sure you understand what changed. What does the organization of the table mean now? What are the groups? How did the numbers change? What does this one particular number mean?\nDon’t beat yourself up if you still feel a bit “awash.” This is surprisingly complicated, especially if you have more than one attribute on the left. It takes time. You will get it.\n\n\nQuestions and Claims\nIn many school statistics (or science) projects, you begin by posing a “research question.” In this case, the question might be, “who earns more—women or men?” It will come as no surprise that the answer is “men.” That’s what we have heard about our society today (or in 2013, when the data were taken). So “who earns more” might seem to be a silly question.\nInstead of a question, sometimes it makes more sense to make a “claim.” This is a statement about what may be true, that you are going to investigate. Our claim might be, “men earn more that women.”\nFor this assignment, we gave you a claim, so you don’t have to worry about making one up. But think about other claims you might make about your data (after all, in the next assignment you get to pick your claim), or how your claim might change as you dig deeper and add nuance to your analysis.\nIn stating your claim, you might also want to say why you think your claim is true. It’s great to have a reason for your claim, but be careful: In most cases for this unit, you won’t have data that will tell you anything about the reasons behind some effect.\nFor example, you might say that you believe people with more education will earn more because they are qualified for higher-paying jobs. Your data can tell you whether they earn more—we have data about education level and income— but we don’t have any data about the educational requirements of the jobs they have.\nIt’s fine to include reasons if you have them, but keep any claim about your data separate from the reasons just as we did above. Here’s how to do it wrong:\nI claim that people with more education are better-qualified for high-paying jobs, and as a result they earn more.\nSee how that’s different? You can’t make a graph about job qualifications. Keep it separate, even if the separator is just the word “because.”"

    "section": "7.3 Commentary",
    "text": "7.3 Commentary\nIdeally, the previous assignment prepared students well for this project. Do plan on class time to help them, and remind them of various resources such as their peers and this book.\nDespite any warnings you might have given about keeping the projects small, some students will probably want to do things that go beyond what you have covered in class. Here are three that happened to us:\nRecoding: Suppose they have income and want to get rid of the number. Instead, they want categories, like “none,” “not much,” and “a lot,” based on some cut points in the numeric income attribute. This is called recoding.\nThey will want a new attribute, a new column, whose value depends on the income attribute. (They should not eliminate that original, but make a new one.) There are two basic strategies: make a formula (which in this case will have some if() statements); or do something that involves typing values into cells. If you have 1000 cases, the typing strategy had better be pretty strategic!\nThey will find some ideas about how to do this in the chapter on the calculating data move.\n\nThis data move, which we call calculating, resembles summarizing, but it creates a new value for each case in a collection rather than a value that summarizes a group. Both data moves often—but not always—use formulas.\n\nAnother classic use of recoding comes up with the Hispanic attribute. It has many categories (notHispanic, Mexican, Guatemalan, Cuban, etc…). It would be great, in some situations, to have a simpler version of that column, maybe called LatinX with only two values: Sí and No. That section explains an easy way to do that.\nAdding data from elsewhere: Sometimes you want to connect the data from two datasets together. This is another data move, called joining, which you can read about in its own chapter.\nJoining can be ridiculously complex, but our student’s idea was reasonable and straightforward: they wanted to compare education levels for people from the richest five States with education levels from the poorest five States. The ACS data did not rate States by wealth, but it’s easy to find a listing on Google.\nSo they simply asked only for data from those ten States, and then recoded the state names into a new column with values rich and poor.\nGetting your own data: Some students may find data about something else that excites them online. If they find a csv file with the data they want, they can drag and drop it into CODAP as described in this section on importing files.\nThe danger for you, the teacher, is that they get data for which grouping and summarizing don’t make sense. So you may want to have them get approval if they stray too far from the data sources we suggest.\n\nIncome inequality and Census data\nIf a student chooses Census data and your claim has a social-justice feel to it, there’s a good chance that it’s at least partly about income inequality.\nNote that there are (at least) two different ways we talk about income differences:\n\nSome groups earn more than others. You often hear about this in the news as a “gender gap” or “race gap” in income.\nWithin a group, the difference between the richest and the poorest might be especially large. You often hear about “rising income inequality,” that is, that difference now is bigger than it was in the past. Or we might compare the USA with, say, Sweden, where incomes are more equal. To do this comparison, you need a number: a measure of income inequality. One such measure is the “Gini coefficient.”\n\nTrying to come up with your own measure of income inequality is an interesting challenge.\n\n\nAssessing the Project\nErnie Chen, the teacher-of-record for the Applied Math class where we ran this in 2020, used this simple 20-point plan. Use or modify as you wish:\n\n\n\nClearly-stated claim\n1\n\n\nInitial graph\n3\n\n\nDoes the graph show or refute initial claim?\n1\n\n\nGrouping: dragging to the left\n3\n\n\nSummary column creation\n3\n\n\nEnhancement: dig deeper\n4\n\n\nCommunication/writing/readability\n4\n\n\nReflection\n1"

    "text": "9.2 More!\n\nLimits to downloads\nThe controls for getting data are fairly self-explanatory, but a few things bear noting:\n\nThere is a limit to how much data you are allowed to get in one request. As a consequence, you may have to be strategic in the data you get. For example, a request for data from Embarcadero to any station gets (of course) fifty times as much data as a request to a single station. So while you can get a whole day of that, you can’t get a week or a month in a single request. That’s fine; being prudent about data is part of data science!\nTo use the between any two stations option, you have to restrict the hours to get only a single hour. (Otherwise it’s too much data.)\nIf you make multiple requests, and they overlap, you will wind up with two copies of the common data.\n\n\n\nThe thing about time\nEvery case has several different attributes for time:\n\nwhen is a “date-time”, where the time is the beginning of the hour the data are from.\nday is the day of the week, which is categorical but will appear ordered correctly.\nhour is an integer, the hour, in a 24-hour system.\ndate is the day (as a date) without the time. It’s categorical.\n\nThese nearly-synonymous attributes help you make different kinds of comparisons. For example, if you want to explore weekly commute patterns, you might make a graph like this, using when for the time:\n\n\n\nOne week of data from Orinda to Embarcadero.\n\n\nBut if you want to overlay the days on top of one another, you should use hour. In this graph, we have selected Friday; you can see that not only do fewer people commute, they do so later:\n\n\n\nThe same week of data from Orinda to Embarcadero, but overlaid with Friday selected.\n\n\nWe made these attributes as a convenience for you as a data-science learner. When you bring in your own data, it will probably be in one format, ansod you will have to do all these transformations yourself.

If necessary, abort the game. Then set Thursday, 160, and 12 noon, but choose surprise me for the location. Then solve the problem. How did you do it? What data did you collect, and why? (Remember, the possibilities for location are Orinda, Hayward, San Bruno, and Pleasant Hill.)\nAgain, but this time,\n\nReduce the size of the meeting\nSet surprise me for two of the remaining parameters"

    "text": "9.5 Commentary\nBesides giving you a chance to interact with a truly huge dataset (albeit only a little at a time), the BART data is a great environment for learning how to think about data in order to get what you want.\nSuppose you decide you’re going to investigate the Giants home game against the LA Dodgers on Tuesday, April 21, 2015. You want to know how many people took BART to the game. How can you figure that out?\nYou’ll be looking at people going to Embarcadero and Montgomery stations. You expect to see a bump in the ridership. But at what times? You should probably look at the data to see when the bump is. But what data? To Embarcadero and Montgomery, but from where? Everywhere, right?\nBut if you do that, you’ll have to add up the data from different stations. Sounds like dragging left and making a new column. But what do you drag left? The station? No.\nTo decide, one strategy is to ask yourself, “What graph do I want to make? What will it look like?”\nThe one in my head has a bump, with riders on the vertical axis and hour on the horizontal. That suggests that we want hour on the left side of the table. Then when we add, we’ll get the sum of the riders—for each hour. Yes. That sounds right.\n\n\n\nSum of riders (called total) from anywhere to Embarcadero for Tuesday afternoon, April 21, 2015.\n\n\nYou can see that there are a slew of similar problems to solve. None of them are mathematically sophisticated, but they can all be challenging and confusing. Here are three:\n\nHow do you add the people from Embarcadero and Montgomery together?\nHow do you account for the people who would have been riding BART anyway whether there was a game or not?\nHow do you know if the bump is for a game or for something else?\n\n\nAs you think about these, notice that the solutions use data moves:\n\nfiltering to get the right data,\ngrouping to set up appropriate comparisons, and\nsummarizing (or aggregating) and calculating to add up the riders and subtract out the “background” traffic.\n\n\nThe very idea of the “background” is an interesting topic. It smells very sciency, is hardly ever talked about in ordinary classwork, and requires only common sense to understand and cope with. To tell how many people went to the game on this Tuesday, April 21, 2015, we need to compare the pattern of ridership to some day when there was no game. Does it matter which day we compare? It might. Maybe it would be best to choose a different Tuesday. But we can’t be sure; maybe we should compare a few different non-game days. And so forth.\n\n\n\nSum of riders from anywhere to Embarcadero for three Tuesdays in April..\n\n\nThis is also closely related to the idea of controlling variables, which we talked about in the commentary about gender differences in income (xxx)."

Just put value on the vertical axis.\nIf you get two temperatures (e.g., tMin and tMax) do the same, and plop what into the middle of the graph.\nIf you mix the data, like you get precipitation and temperature, your graphs will be unruly unless you use the spreader.

This is usually what you want. Also, this means you do not have to worry about tidy datasets or spreading.\nThe data go back, apparently, only to 1970.\nI have had trouble entering dates sometimes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ‘big’ NOAA data portal.
