# Adjustment and Control {#adjustment-chapter}

::: {.callout-warning}
Very, very under construction :)
:::

In this chapter we will (eventually) 
discuss adjusting data for trends or baselines, 
and relate that to "controlling" for variables.

This is inspired by the problem of, for example,
using BART data to assess how many people took BART to a game on Wednesday.
The na√Øve student would sum the number of riders over a period of a few hours.
That's good, but you should _subtract_ the number of people who would be taking BART 
at that time anyway.
And how do you determine that?
Some ideas:

* Look at a nearby non-game day.
* Look at a non-game _Wednesday_.
* Look at a lot of non-game Wednesdays.

_Adjustment_ will address ideas such as "adjusted for inflation" and "seasonally adjusted"---
means of making fair comparisons when underlying trends change the data values.

In that section we'll also get to address calculations like "tall for your age" or "warm for February."
