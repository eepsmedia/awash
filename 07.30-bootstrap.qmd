# Randomization and Estimation: the Bootstrap {#bootstrap-chapter}

By "estimation" we mean, estimating a parameter.
This parameter might be a property of some object, 
like the diameter of the Moon. 
An individual measurement will have some error, 
so you take multiple measurements and average them.

A key point here is that the resulting estimate is not just the average you get;
it's an _interval_. 
You'll say that your estimate of the diameter is 
some big number "plus or minus" some small number.

In a traditional stats class, you learn to use _confidence intervals_ to 
do estimation, and compute that interval. 
It might be a measurement, like the moon,
or some parameter of a population like the percentage of people who support a candidate,
or the mean weight of capybaras.
The idea is that you will be 95% "confident" that the true value of your parameter
is in the interval.

You could call our version of the confidence interval a _plausibility_ interval.

## A bootstrapping example

Suppose you measure the weights of 10 capybaras 
and you find that their mean weight is 47 kilograms.
If these capybaras are a suitably random sample of all capybaras, 
what can you say about the mean weight of all capybaras?

Clearly our best guess is 47 kilos as well. 
But will it be _exactly_ 47 kilograms? Of course not.
Capybaras vary in weight, and there's no way we accidentally, randomly,
got 10 capybaras that were perfectly representative of the whole species.

The big question is, how far off of the population mean is 
the mean of our single sample likely to be?

To find out, we do something that kinda sorta 
smells like what we did with randomization tests and scrambling.

Here's the plan:

We write the weights of all ten capybaras on chips and 
put them into a bag.
Then we draw out ten chips, record the numbers, and find the mean.
However, _we put each chip back after we draw it_.
That is, we are sampling _with replacement_.
This is called a "bootstrap sample."

Because we put them back every time,  we'll probably get some duplicates.
Similarly, some of our capybaras won't be represented in a particular bootstrap sample. 
Therefore the means we get won't be exactly the same as the mean of our "real" sample.
Some means will be larger, some smaller, depending on which chips we pulled. 

We will do this many times, and then look at the _distribution_ of means in order to assess
how far off our single-sample mean is likely to be. 

### Your first bootstrap: April in Paris

We don't have measurements of capybaras, so instead we'll use temperatures, in this case,
high temperatures from Paris, France during April 2023.
Our question is, what is the mean high temperature in Paris in April?

The mean for that month was 15.9 °C.
