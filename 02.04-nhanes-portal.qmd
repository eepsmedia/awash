# The NHANES Data Portal {#nhanes-chapter}

This brief chapter describes a data portal that gives
you access to several thousand cases from the
2003 National Health And Nutrition Examination Survey 
([NHANES](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm)).
This is the dataset where we got the 800 children and teens we used 
in two of the lessons in this book.

A box at the top of the portal lets you choose your sample size,
and a button will get your data.
When the data downloads, a CODAP table appears with the data in it.

The portal has three panels:

* **summary**: This describes what you have chosen to download.
It includes a list of the attributes you have chosen.
* **attributes**: (Shown in the illustration.) 
Here you can choose which attributes you want.
You can pick them from several different broad categories. 
This is similar to the Census/ACS portal design you have already used.
* **cases**: This lets you limit the range of ages of the people you will get.
You do not have to fill in both boxes.
