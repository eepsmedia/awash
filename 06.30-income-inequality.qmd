# Income Inequality {#project-income-inequality}

Somewhere I pointed out that when we say "income inequality," 
we mean at least two things:

* Some groups have higher incomes than others. 
Stereotypically, for example, men earn more than women; whites earn more than blacks.
* Some *populations* have greater income disparities than others. 
When you hear statistics like, "the top 1% of people have 50% of the wealth," 
that's an example of this second kind of inequality.
