# Plugin Logistics {#plugins-chapter}

Although CODAP is pretty capable just on its own,
we often wish it would do more.
This is especially important in data science.

Fortunately, we have plugins. Plugins extend CODAP's functionality. 
These lessons have already used plugins such as the BART data portal.

The thing is, in the lessons you're seen, he plugins were already installed.
Somebody set up a codap file with the plugin in place and shared it. 

But what if you're a teacher and you want to set up a new file for your students,
one that uses a new plugin? 
How do you do that?

There are at least three ways. 

## But first...

Some basics.

A plugin occupies a rectangular area in the CODAP window.
In that way it's like a table or a graph.

## Method 1: Drag and Drop

## Method 2: Import

## Method 3: Use the URL
