# Fbola: Introducing Trees {#tree-introduction-chapter}

Let's begin our study of trees with a pandemic.
We've all just been through COVID, so let's not go there.
Instead, we'll invent a new disease, called Fbola
(it's the one that comes after Ebola).

We've heard on the news that one of the main symptoms of Fbola 
is a red rash covering your face.
Before patents get the rash, however, they have a fever for a couple of days. 
Doctors think that anyone with the rash or the fever is highly contagious.

We want to screen students arriving at school;
if we find a student with Fbola, we will send them home.
One sensible policy might look like this:

* If you have a rash, you have to go home.
* If you don't have a rash, we take your temperature. 
If you have a fever, you have to go home.
* Otherwise, you stay in school.

We can express that in a tree diagram:

```{r  echo = FALSE, out.width = "30%", fig.cap='A tree representing the logic of our Fbola policy.', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("art/trees-fbola-intro.png"))
```

Notice that the diagram has the same logic as the words. 
Another version of the words uses the logical connector `or`.
Of course, the "or" is "inclusive";
it means, one or the other, _or both_:

> If you have a rash _or_ if you have a fever, you have to go home. 

Let's move on. 

We got the information about how to tell if somebody has Fbola from the news,
and the news people presumably got it from some doctors or a health agency.
But where did they get their information? 
From data.

Let's imagine there is no agency publishing advice. 
We decide to collect data on our own and analyze it.
We notice that people have rashes and fevers
